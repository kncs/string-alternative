# String Alternative

String Alternative is a very small and simple javascript module created to help people to render different strings taking account different conditions.

Because a code example is probably more explicit than a long speech ...

# Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save string-alternative
```

# Code Examples

```javascript
var StringAlternative = require('string-alternative');

/* zero, one and many example */
for(var i=0; i<=10; i++) {
  var sa = StringAlternative()
    .count(i)
    .zero('Nobody is viewing')
    .one('One person is viewing')
    .many( i + ' people are viewing');

  console.log(sa.toString());
}

// Nobody is viewing
// One person is viewing
// 2 people are viewing
// 3 people are viewing
// 4 people are viewing
// 5 people are viewing
// 6 people are viewing
// 7 people are viewing
// 8 people are viewing
// 9 people are viewing
// 10 people are viewing

/* default, prefix and suffix example */

for(var i=0; i<=10; i++) {
  var sa = StringAlternative()
    .default(' result')
    .prefix('I found ' + i)
    .many(' results')
    .suffix(' matching with you research !')
    .count(i);

  console.log(sa.toString());
}

// I found 0 result matching with you research !
// I found 1 result matching with you research !
// I found 2 results matching with you research !
// I found 3 results matching with you research !
// I found 4 results matching with you research !
// I found 5 results matching with you research !
// I found 6 results matching with you research !
// I found 7 results matching with you research !
// I found 8 results matching with you research !
// I found 9 results matching with you research !
// I found 10 results matching with you research !
```

# Motivation

At the very begining of this project, the aim was to create a tiny module to manage one specific use case, ie allow a developper to get a readable and a super easy way for build different strings according to a number (0=>'No result', 1=>'One result', N=>'N results').

But why should I restrict the condition to be a equal to zero, one or many ? There is absolutly no reason and that's why I decided to implement other conditions (above, below, between, oneOf, ...)

# API Reference

## `.count(number)`

Define a number used as reference into the conditions

## `.default(str)`

Define a default string returned by the toString method when an alternative string is not defined

## `.prefix(str)`

Define a string to prefix result returned by the toString method

## `.suffix(str)`

Define a string to suffix result returned by the toString method

## `.toString()`

Return the alternative string matching with condition

## `.zero(str)`

Define the alternative string for a reference number equal to zero

## `.one(str)`

Define the alternative string for a reference number equal to one

## `.many(str)`

Define the "alternative string" for a reference number above one

## `.zom(zero, one, many)`

Define the three alternatives strings

# Roadmap

See below the list of next features which will be imlemented as soon as possible :

* ~~.default(str)~~
* ~~.prefix(str)~~
* ~~.suffix(str)~~
* .above(trigger, str)
* .below(trigger, str)
* .between(startTrigger, endTrigger, str)
* .oneOf(array, str)
* .equal(value, str)
* ...
