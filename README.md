# String Alternative

String Alternative is a very small and simple javascript module created to help people to render different strings taking account different conditions.

Because a code example is probably more explicit than a long speech ...

# Code Example

```javascript
var StringAlternative = require('string-alternative');

for(var i=0; i<=10; i++) {
  var sa = StringAlternative()
    .count(i)
    .zero('Nobody is viewing')
    .one('One person is viewing')
    .many( i + ' people are viewing');

  console.log(sa.toString());

  // Nobody is viewing
  // One person is viewing
  // 2 people are viewing
  // 3 people are viewing
  // 4 people are viewing
  // 5 people are viewing
  // 6 people are viewing
  // 7 people are viewing
  // 8 people are viewing
  // 9 people are viewing
  // 10 people are viewing
```

# Motivation

At the very begining of this project, the aim was to create a tiny module to manage one specific use case, ie allow a developper to get a readable and a super easy way for build different strings according to a number (0=>'No result', 1=>'One result', N=>'N results').

But why should I restrict the condition to be a equal to zero, one or many ? There is absolutly no reason and that's why I decided to implement other conditions (above, below, between, oneOf, ...)

# Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save string-alternative
```

# API Reference

## `.count(number)`

Define a number used as reference into the conditions

## `.toString()`

Return the alternative string matching with condition

## `.zero(str)`

Define the alternative string for a reference number equal to zero

## `.one(str)`

Define the alternative string for a reference number equal to one

## `.many(str)`

Define the "alternative string" for a reference number above one

## `.zom(zero, one, many)`

Define the three alternatives strings

# Roadmap

See below the list of next features which will be imlemented as soon as possible :

* .default(str)
* .prefix(str)
* .suffix(str)
* .above(trigger, str)
* .below(trigger, str)
* .between(startTrigger, endTrigger, str)
* .oneOf(array, str)
* .equal(value, str)
* ...
